# **FastAPI Online Lending App: Implementation Guide**

FastAPI enables building a high-performance lending platform with a Python backend and modern web frontends. The system typically includes a FastAPI REST API (with asynchronous endpoints) backed by a relational database (e.g. PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy), and two frontend apps (Admin Panel and User Dashboard) built in React/Vite. The backend handles business logic and data, while the React frontends consume the API (with CORS enabled fastapi.tiangolo.com), and optionally use WebSockets for real-time notifications. We also use Celery (or FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks) for long-running tasks, and robust security (JWT/OAuth2 auth, RBAC, input validation, HTTPS). Testing is done via pytest and FastAPI’s TestClient.

**Database Setup (SQLAlchemy & Alembic)**
Use SQLAlchemy ORM models to define tables. For example, a User model with fields like id, username/email, hashed_password, and role (e.g. “user” or “admin”); a Loan model with fields id, user_id (FK to Users), amount, interest_rate (4%), term_months (48), monthly_payment, status (Enum: “Under-Review”, “Approved”, “Rejected”, “Withdrawn”, etc.), application_number, and possibly a contract file/path; and a Transaction model with id, user_id, optional loan_id, type (Enum: “deposit” or “withdrawal”), amount, timestamp, etc. Define relationships (e.g. User.loans, User.transactions, Loan.transactions). Example (using declarative_base() or SQLModel) could look like:

Use Alembic for migrations. In alembic/env.py , set target_metadata = Base.metadata soAlembic can auto-generate migrations based on your models . Then use commands like alembic revision --autogenerate and alembic upgrade head to apply schema changes. This ensures database schemas stay in sync with your models. (Alternatively, for initial setup, you can call Base.metadata.create_all(engine) on app startup.) As the app evolves, write migrations for any schema updates (adding fields, tables, etc.).

_Database config_: Store the connection string (e.g. in an environment variable like DATABASE_URL ) anduse SQLAlchemy’s create_engine().
For example:

`engine = create_engine(os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"))`
`SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)`

Then provide a get_db() dependency (using FastAPI’s Depends ) that yields a SessionLocal() for each request, ensuring proper session/rollback management.

**API Endpoints**
Implement RESTful CRUD endpoints using FastAPI routers. Key endpoints include:

_Register_: - POST /register (create user), POST /login (user log in), POST /logout (user log out).

_Users_: - GET /users/ (admin only: list all users), - GET /users/{id} (user or admin view profile), - PUT /users/{id} (update profile; admin can update any user), - DELETE /users/{id} (admin only).

_Loans_: - POST /loans/apply : user applies for a loan (create Loan with status “Applied”). - GET /loans/ : Admin sees all loans, Regular user sees only their own loans. - GET /loans/{loan*id} : details of a loan (with Pydantic schema for response). - PUT /loans/{loan_id}/approve : admin approves loan (set status to “Approved” and record date). - PUT /loans/{loan_id}/withdraw : user (or admin on behalf) marks loan as withdrawn (disburse funds). - DELETE /loans/{loan_id} : admin rejects or deletes a loan application.
\_Transactions*: - GET /transactions/ : list of transactions (admin all, user’s own). - POST /transactions/deposit : user makes a deposit (increase balance). - POST /transactions/withdraw : user withdraws approved loan amount or funds (only allowed if loan approved and funds available). Optionally - POST /transactions/repay : for loan repayments (if tracked).

Each endpoint should use FastAPI’s dependencies to handle DB sessions and authentication. For example:

`@app.get("/loans/")`
`async def list_loans(db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: User =`
`Depends(get_current_user)):`
`if current_user.role == "admin":`
`return db.query(Loan).all()`
`return db.query(Loan).filter(Loan.user_id == current_user.id).all()`

Use Pydantic models for request/response schemas (with orm_mode=True for ORM integration). FastAPI auto-generates docs (OpenAPI) for all paths.

Use CORS middleware to allow your React frontends to access the API. For example:

`origins = ["http://localhost:5173", "https://admin.localhost:5173"]`
`app.add_middleware(`
`CORSMiddleware,`
`allow_origins=origins,`
`allow_credentials=True,`
`allow_methods=["*"],`
`allow_headers=["*"],)`

By default, browsers block cross-origin calls unless allowed (FastAPI docs explain configuring
CORSMiddleware ).

_Tip: Organize your routes with FastAPI’s APIRouter (e.g. auth_router , user_router , loan_router ) and include them in app.include_router(...) . This keeps code modular (e.g. separate files for models, schemas, routers)._

**Authentication & RBAC**
Use JWT-based authentication (OAuth2 password flow). On login, verify user credentials (hash and compare using e.g. bcrypt via PassLib) and return a signed JWT token. The token payload can include the user’s ID and role; set an expiration (e.g. 15–60 minutes) and a secret key. As FastAPI docs note, JWT tokens are signed and can include an expiration, so the server can verify them without storing session state . Store the secret and algorithm in config. In FastAPI, use OAuth2PasswordBearer for routes: it reads the Authorization: Bearer <token> header and returns the user info.

For password hashing, use a strong algorithm like bcrypt via PassLib (FastAPI recommends this ). Never store plain passwords; store only hashes. On user registration, hash the password, and on login, verify the hash.

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) by storing a role attribute on the User model (e.g. “admin” vs “user”). Create dependency functions that check the user’s role, for example:

`def get_current_admin(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):`
`if current_user.role != "admin":`
`raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not authorized")`
`return current_user`

Then secure admin routes with Depends(get_current_admin) . RBAC ensures each user has the appropriate access based on role . For example, only admins can access endpoints like listing all users or all loans. Regular users can only access their own data.

_Note: Don't integrate OAuth (e.g. Google Sign-In) for login by callbacks and creating users on the fly. But keep JWT as primary auth method._
